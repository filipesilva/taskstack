# Why taskstack?
Because whenever I'm working on something non-trivial, it feel like I'm pushing and popping subtasks out of a FILO stack. I figured a visual way to track it would help me focus.

# Where can I see it in action?
Right here on github, since this is a github page. Head over to http://filipesilva.github.io/taskstack/ and take it out for a spin.

# How was such an impressive technological construct actually built?
I'm glad you asked! It was made from a github pages Merlot template, with some basic AngularJS wiring.
